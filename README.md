# Advent of Code 2024

In this repository I will post my daily solutions for Advent of Code 2024.

I will add solutions the next day after they were released to prevent any spoilers.


## Language(s)

I am as yet undecided on what language I would like to use this year. Primarily
I will likely use Haskell, as it lends itself well to these sorts of
challenges, but I also would like to challenge myself and try a few new
languages.

As such, some of the days I might choose other languages within I'm unfamiliar with,
or potentially write multiple solutions in different languages.

Also, there often tend to be a few challenges which are easier in one language
than another for whatever reason, so I will take that into account.
